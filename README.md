Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a Spam Email Detection System created as part of my internship at CipherByte Technologies. The goal of this project is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam using Machine Learning techniques.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and text preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: Transforming textual data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization.
Modeling: Implemented multiple classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build the detection model.
Evaluation: Comparing the performance of different models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib



Unemployment Analysis with Python :

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze unemployment trends and patterns using real-world data. The analysis is performed using Python and its powerful data handling libraries. Through this project, we explore factors contributing to unemployment and visualize these trends for better insights.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing unemployment data to uncover insights and patterns.
Data Visualization: Creating graphs and charts to visualize unemployment trends over time, across regions, and in relation to various economic indicators.
Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods to understand unemployment trends.

Tools & Technologies
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Insights & Findings
This project helped uncover critical insights about unemployment patterns over time and across different regions. It provides a clear picture of how unemployment fluctuates and the factors that contribute to these changes.

Conclusion
The Unemployment Analysis project highlights the power of data in understanding societal issues. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we can better understand unemployment trends and patterns, which can help policymakers and economists make informed decisions.
